      <p>I am Swati Sagarika Bhuyan, a cybersecurity studentüë©‚Äçüíª and aspiring tech leader, passionate about design, security and love building cute websitesüëæ and apps through codes.I also create aesthetic UGC contents‚ú® and love singingüé§ and journaling. <br>As a kid i always wanted to be either a singer or a doctor but my plane landed on engineering somehow. I started my coding journey with null experiences. I was not good at coding. I tried a lot of websited initially nothing really worked for someone like me whose a complete beginner. And then i got intorduced to <b>‚ú®Cod√©dex‚ú®</b>, the more i used it the more i gained my interest for coding. And now i code really better and i love coding. I love how the aesthetics of <b>Cod√©dex</b> is pixel based which gives a vibe of playing games. <br>I'm also exploring Python, UI/UX and digital content creation. Briefly i'm learning to bring logic and creativity together‚ú®.</br></p>

        <h3>Nyxa Project~</h3>
        <p>I built my first project using only HTML that is a restaurant menu page. I made it after completing the HTML course from <b>Cod√©dex</b>. Honestly, I used to hate coding, but <b>Cod√©dex</b> helped me grow so much that now I actually love it! This personal website you're seeing right now is my second project that is built using both HTML and CSS.<br>I also once tried creating a basic calculator using Python but it wasn't perfect, but it made me curious to keep learning.
          Every project I make now feels like a step closer to the creative, confident version of me I'm becoming.</br></p>
